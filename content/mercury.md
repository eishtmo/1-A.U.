## Visibility

Most people have never seen Mercury in the sky.

Mercury is always close to Sun in the sky.

Mercury is only seen in during twilight, it is never seen against a dark sky.

A low, clear horizon is needed to observe.

Mercury as a monring star is only seen when it rises shortly before Sun in autumn (Sept/Oct in northern hemisphere).

Mercury as an evening star is seen when it sets shortly after Sun in the Spring (March/April).

This seasonal cycle of visibility is because Mercury's year of 88 days to orbit Sun is of similar duration as our seasons.

Though Mercury can be as bright as Sirius, the glowing twilight makes it difficut to see without binoculars.
